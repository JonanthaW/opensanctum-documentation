# OpenSanctum API Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the [OpenSanctum](https://www.opensanctum.com) API — your gateway to discovering and contributing to a global directory of churches, temples, mosques, and sacred sites.


## 🔍 Overview

OpenSanctum is an open, community-driven API platform that provides comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date information about churches, religions, and holy places around the world. Designed with developers and enthusiasts in mind, OpenSanctum offers a rich dataset accessible through a RESTful API built on modern technologies including Java 21, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Angular.

The project aims to foster global cultural and religious knowledge sharing by allowing users to contribute new data, verify existing entries, and engage with a vibrant community. OpenSanctum balances ease of access with robust security via token-based authentication, role management, and a subscription model offering enhanced features.

Whether you’re building an app, researching religious sites, or contributing to a worldwide database, OpenSanctum provides a reliable and extensible platform to meet your needs.
No authentication is required for public endpoints, and contributions are welcome!
