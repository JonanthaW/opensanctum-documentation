# For Developers

OpenSanctum is designed to be developer-friendly, providing clear, well-documented RESTful endpoints and a modern tech stack to facilitate integration and extension.
Key Features for Developers:

    * REST API with Pagination & Filtering: Access detailed data on churches, religions, and holy places with flexible query parameters and pagination support.

    * Token-Based Authentication: Secure endpoints with JWTs; public endpoints exist for basic data retrieval.

    * Role-Based Access Control: Differentiate users by roles like ROLE_USER, ROLE_SANCTUM, and ROLE_FAITHFUL to control access to features and data.

    * Caching: Uses method-level caching to improve performance for frequent queries.

    * Contribution Workflow: Developers can submit new data through temporary tables that require approval before becoming public.


Getting Started:

    * Use Postman or similar tools to test authentication and API endpoints.

    * Implement your own clients by including the JWT in the Authorization header with Bearer <token>.

    * Review the entity models and service layers to understand the data structures and business logic.

    * Contribute to the project by submitting issues, pull requests, or reporting bugs.

Important Notes:

    * Registration is only available through the official website to maintain data integrity.

    * User roles and permissions are crucial for accessing protected endpoints; always authenticate before calling these.

    * Future plans include adding subscription-based premium roles and enhanced community tools.
